Dead simple, **S**elf-**C**ontained, single-file **API** load testing tool built on FastAPI.

---

Sometimes, I need a simple tool to make a few requests to external APIs, create a bit of load, experiment with headers, check the average response time, and so on. I want to be able to launch this tool from any environment with one click without having to figure anything out.

The existing tools seemed inconvenient to me, so I created a tiny tool that generates load and can be launched with just one command. Thanks to the inline metadata format and the uv package and project manager, there's no need to manually set up environments.

You just need Python installed on the target machine, and that's it.

## Requirements
+ Python version 3.10* or higher.
+ Install the [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).



\* It may work on other versions, but I haven't tested them as I don't see much point in doing so.
